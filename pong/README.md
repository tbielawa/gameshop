# hey, sup?

This project is what I'm using to learn the
[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/hifi.html) Python library. In other
words, I'm figuring out how to clone the classic Atari game, *two
paddles, one ball*.

# Requirements

*this is probably an incomplete list, sorry buds*

* The pygame library for your system. Here's a link to their download
  page, [ka-ching!](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

* **Note** As an alternative, your operating system may include a
  pygame specific package
